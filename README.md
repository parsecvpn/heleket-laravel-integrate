- **Laravel** 9.0 or higher

## Quick Start

If you prefer to install this package into your own Laravel application, please follow the installation steps below

## Installation

#### Step 1. Install a Laravel project if you don't have one already

https://laravel.com/docs/installation

#### Step 2. Require the current package using composer:

```bash
composer require parsecvpn/heleket-laravel-integrate
```

#### Step 3. Publish the controller file and config file

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Parsecvpn\Heleket\HeleketServiceProvider" --tag="heleket"
```

If publishing files fails, please create corresponding files at the path `config/heleket.php` and `app\Http\Controllers\HeleketControllers.php` from this package. And you can also further customize the HeleketControllers.php file to suit your project.

#### Step 4. Update the various config settings in the published config file:

After publishing the package assets a configuration file will be located at <code>config/heleket.php</code>. Please contact heleket.com to get those values to fill into the config file.

#### Step 5. Add middleware protection:

###### app/Http/Kernel.php

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    // Other kernel properties...
    
    /**
     * The application's route middleware groups.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        // Other middlewares...
         'heleket' => 'App\Http\Middleware\HeleketMiddleware',
    ];
}
```

#### Step 6. Add route:

###### routes/api.php

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\HeleketController;

// Other routes properties...

Route::group(['middleware' => ['heleket']], function () {
    Route::post('/heleket/webhook', [HeleketController::class, 'webhook']);
});

}
```

Then your IPN (Webhook) URL will be something like https://yourdomain.ltd/api/heleket/webhook, and you should provide it to Heleket's account setting. You could provide it to `routes/web.php` if you want but remember that Heleket will check for referer matched with the pre-registration URL. So make sure that you provide them the right URL of website.

            'https://yourdomain.ltd/invoices/INV-test-01',
            'https://yourdomain.ltd/invoices/INV-test-01?success=true' // Remember that param success=true or any similar is just for toast notification, do not put any logical process here
        );
    }
}
```
